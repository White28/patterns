# Java Design Patterns

Some of the benefits of using design patterns are:

1. Design Patterns are already defined and provides industry standard approach to solve a recurring problem, so it saves time if we sensibly use the design pattern. There are many java design patterns that we can use in our java based projects.

2. Using design patterns promotes reusability that leads to more robust and highly maintainable code. It helps in reducing total cost of ownership (TCO) of the software product.

3. Since design patterns are already defined, it makes our code easy to understand and debug. It leads to faster development and new members of team understand it easily.
    
Java Design Patterns are divided into three categories â€“ creational, structural, and behavioral design patterns.

[Creational Design Patterns](https://github.com/White28/patterns/tree/master/src/com/white/creational)

- [x] [Abstract Factory Pattern](https://github.com/White28/patterns/tree/master/src/com/white/creational/abstractfactory)
- [x] [Builder Pattern](https://github.com/White28/patterns/tree/master/src/com/white/creational/builder)
